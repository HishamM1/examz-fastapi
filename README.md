# Examz
Examz empowers teachers with NLP-based answer similarity assessment and comprehensive data analysis reports for in-depth student exam performance analysis.

## For teachers
You can easily create exams and questions that are tailored to your specific needs. Our platform offers a variety of question types ranging from multiple-choice to open-ended, allowing you to design exams that accurately assess your student's knowledge and understanding. Additionally, you can invite students to join your exams and monitor their progress in real time. 

## For students
Our platform provides a simple and efficient way to take exams created by their teachers. Once you take an exam, you can answer questions and receive immediate feedback on your performance. Our system is designed to ensure that all exams are conducted fairly and securely, giving students the confidence they need to perform their best.

## FastAPI
- In addition to Laravel and Nuxt, we have integrated Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities using Python. Through FastAPI, we have built an API that measures the similarity between a teacher's answer and a student's answer in open-ended questions. By sending both answers as requests, the API responds with a similarity percentage, providing valuable insights for assessment.
- We leveraged data analysis capabilities to enable teachers to generate individualized performance reports for each student, providing in-depth insights into their exam performance using plotly.

## Deployment
API is deployed on render.com
